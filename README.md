# SatelliteNetworkSim
A simulation tool designed to model, analyze, and optimize satellite networks. This repository provides algorithms and tools for simulating satellite constellations, inter-satellite communications, and ground station interactions. Ideal for researchers, engineers, and enthusiasts in the fields of aerospace, telecommunications, and network design.

## Context  
This project addresses the challenge of designing a satellite network to provide connectivity to the most disconnected regions of Colombia, such as La Guajira, Amazonas, and others. The goal is to explore how satellite networks can bridge the digital divide in these underserved areas.  

## Approach  
We consider terrestrial satellite networks focusing on GEO (Geostationary Earth Orbit) and LEO (Low Earth Orbit) constellations. For simplicity, this simulation does not account for Earth's rotation but provides a baseline model for network design and performance analysis.  

## Simulation  
The initial simulation was conducted using Universe Sandbox, establishing the first parameters for building the satellite network model. These include:  
- Defining orbital parameters for GEO and LEO satellites.  
- Positioning satellites to maximize coverage over target regions.  
- Simulating basic communication links and analyzing potential coverage gaps.
